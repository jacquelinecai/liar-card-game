# Description of the project.

  Our project is a single-player Liar Card Game. This game is similar to the BS 
  game that can be played with 3+ players and a standard deck of cards. To begin 
  the game, a player will first put down any cards of their choice, with the 
  same number. The first player can choose to start with any number of their 
  choice. The next player would continue by placing cards with the same number 
  as the previous player. Other players can choose to flip over the player's 
  cards if they think the player is lying. If the player is lying, then the 
  player takes the whole pile of cards that are placed down, otherwise the 
  person who flipped the card over has to take the pile. The game would continue 
  with the next player putting down any cards of their choice until one player 
  has no cards left.
