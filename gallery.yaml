# Description of the project.
desc: >
  Our project is a single-player Liar Card Game. This game is similar to the BS game that can be played with 3+ players and a standard deck of cards. To begin the game, a player will first put down any cards, with the same number, of their choice. The next player would continue by placing cards of the same number as the first player. Other players can choose to flip over the player's cards if they think the player is lying. If the player is lying, then he takes the whole pile of cards that are placed down, otherwise the person who flipped the card over has to take the pile. The game would continue with the next player putting down any cards o their choice until one player has no cards left.
