1. You start off the game. At the start of each round, the selected player will choose the card type they claim to place down
2. Each player will have the option of passing the round or placing down up to 4 cards
3. If at any point during the game, you believe that the other players have lied in their card placement, instantiate the BS callout. If you're correct in your assumption, that player will collect all the cards on the table. If you're incorrect in your assumption, you must collect all the cards on the table.
