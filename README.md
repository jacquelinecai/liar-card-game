### Liar Card Game

This is a single-player Liar Card Game. This game is similar to the BS game that can be played with 4 players and a standard deck of cards. To begin the game, a player will first put down any cards of their choice, with the same number. The first player can choose to start with any number of their choice. The next player would continue by placing cards with the same number as the previous player. Other players can choose to flip over the player's cards if they think the player is lying. If the player is lying, then the player takes the whole pile of cards that are placed down, otherwise the person who flipped the card over has to take the pile. The game would continue with the next player putting down any cards of their choice until one player has no cards left.
